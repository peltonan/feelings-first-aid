# Feelings First Aid

## What is this app about?

A simple survey with "Yes" and "No" questions.
After answering every question, you will get the answer/s.

The app is made to help you solve mood issues that you might be having.

This is my first React project done with a mentor.

## What did I learn?

My part was mostly CSS and HTML, and that was my main focus.

I learned basic React functionality with Takirami.

We also did some peer programming.
