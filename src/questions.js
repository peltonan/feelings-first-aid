        yesValue: "I'm tired asf/I suffer from insomnia",
        noValue: "I've slept like a baby",
        answer: "You need to get some more sleep. Try getting earlier to bed today or take a short nap. If you suffer from insomnia, I recommend seeing a medical professional who can help you."

    {
        question: "Do you have a lot of stress right now? Something big happening in your life?",
        yesValue: "Shit is going down, I can't calm down",
        noValue: "Everything is fine, I have peace of mind",
        answer: "Stress is a part of life unfortunately, but most things will pass. However, try to find time to relax and do something you enjoy. Meditate, play video games, watch a movie, do something to let your head rest."

        question: "Are you hungry? Have you forgotten to eat a proper meal?",
        yesValue: "I'm hangry! Gimme food!",
        noValue: "I'm fine, thank you",

        question: "Have you been inactive and spent most of the day inside?",
        yesValue: "I've been glued to the couch",
        noValue: "I've been outside, seen the world a bit",
        answer: "Go outside for a walk or something. Changing your scenery and fresh air is good for you. Sometimes just a 30min walk outside can make a big difference in your mood."
    },
    {
        question: "Have you spent the day not talking to anyone you like? Had to deal with difficult people?",
        yesValue: "So f*cking annoying!",
        noValue: "I've had a good time socializing",
        answer: "Try to find someone to talk to. Someone you like, trust and feel comfortable being around. Another option, is taking some time for yourself, taking a break from people."

    {
        question: "Has someone judged you or treated you badly today? Has someone hurt your feelings?",
        yesValue: "I'm upset. Humans suck!",
        noValue: "Everyone has treated me well",
        answer: "Don't waste energy on negative thoughts and people. Process your feelings, maybe talk to someone you trust and then let it go. Consider if there's a need for confrontation, but don't make rash decisions, sleep on it. "
    },
    {

        noValue: "Nothing bothers me right now",
        answer: " Process your feelings. Write or talk to someone you trust. Try to find a way to let things go. If you feel there's something you can do or change, sleep on it, and then take action. However, be sure to assess the situation, is it worth your energy and time?"
    },
    {
        question: "Are you thinking about bad memories, having negative thoughts about something?",
        yesValue: "I keep spiraling into an abyss of shit",
        noValue: "I'm in control of my mind",
        answer: "Process your feelings and don't give your negative thoughts control. Talk to someone you trust or write. If you keep slipping back, try to keep your mind occupied with other things. Keep yourself busy, so your mind has less time to wander."
    },

        yesValue: "I've made some awful choices",
        noValue: "I'm happy with how things are in my life",

    },
    {
        question: "Have you been busy all day with work/obligations, not having any time for yourself?",
        yesValue: "I haven't had any time for myself",

        answer: "Make time for yourself. Take a break. Do something you enjoy. I know it might not be easy, if you have a busy schedule. But you and your brain will thank you for a much needed break."
    },
    {
        question: "Are you shaming yourself? Are you shaming your body, weight or your looks?",
        yesValue: "I don't like how I look, I want to change",
        noValue: "I'm pretty happy with myself, flaws and all",
        answer: "There's only one you, and you're unique in your own way. Learn to love yourself, everyone is flawed, no one is perfect. But if you want a change, for example, you want to lose weight, figure out how to accomplish that."
    },
    {

        noValue: "I got plans/I'm doing something I enjoy",
        answer: "Get up and start doing something you enjoy, chores or whatever. Even if you're not feeling motivated and it feels difficult to get up. After awhile you might get a flow, really get into what you're doing or having fun. Things rarely get better by doing nothing. Take action."
    },

        noValue: "I'm content, I wouldn't want to change it",
        answer: "A new job or a career switch is in order. Take time figuring out what you want to do. Start saving up. Start looking for a new job. Take small steps to get somewhere. It can be scary, but sometimes you have to take a risk to make a change."

        noValue: "I'm happy being single, don't need a partner/I'm in a happy relationship.",
        answer: "If you're single, don't give up. Try to look for a partner in different places. Look out for red flags, but don't be too picky. If you're already in a relationship, and things are bad, try to figure out how to improve things. If you have an abusive partner who doesn't change, think about breaking up."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you feel lonely? Do you feel like you don't have any friends?",
        yesValue: "I feel like I have no one to talk to or someone I can trust.",
        noValue: "I have friends that I can trust/I'm an introvert, and like to be by myself.",
        answer: "Try to look for friends in new places or maybe you have someone in your life you can get to know better. Sometimes you can also have a feeling that you don't have friends, even though in reality you do. You just feel this way for no reason, even though you know it isn't true."
